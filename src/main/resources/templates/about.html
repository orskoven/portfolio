    I'am Simon, an aspiring developer studying an AP in Computer Science at KEA.
        My fianc√© and I live in the eastern part of central copenhagen in a three-room apartment.
        I have been living here for about six years, after I spend my teenage years in Southern Denmark.
        Studying an AP in Computer Science has convinced me that IT i somewhat my natural habitat.
        I can't get my hands down from all the possibilities that programming and coding brings.
